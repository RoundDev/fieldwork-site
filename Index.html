<h2>Project Description: Cloud-Based Fieldwork System for dispatching and completing work in the field</h2>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KUB has multiple applications for dispatching and completing work in the field. This field work consists of jobs like starting a customerâ€™s utility service, reading a meter, restoring power, fixing a water leak, or inspecting a gas line. Each job is dispatched to a field worker, the field worker completes the work and documents the work that was completed. This documentation can include filling out forms and taking before/after pictures. KUB is interested in exploring the use of cloud-based technologies to provide a single solution for dispatching and completing work in the field.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cloud-based Fieldwork System is a proof of concept for KUB. We are developing mobile and dispatch applications implemented in Ember JS using Firebase hosting for data, photos, static web pages, database, and security. We are using GitHub for source control, Heroku for hosting as well as NodeJS applications.
