## The Idea Behind the Class
The student project pairs student teams with businesses or other entities to gain some real-world experience before graduating.
## Project Charter
This cloud-based Fieldwork System is a proof of concept for KUB to develop mobile and dispatch applications. These will be implemented in Ember JS using Firebase hosting for data, photos, static web pages, database, and security. We are using GitHub for source control, Heroku for hosting as well as NodeJS applications.
### Plans
KUB is in the process of switching out all of their electric meters. They want to include before and after photos of this to ensure correct meter reading at the time of the switch.
